# Baymax AI

## Project Overview

**Baymax AI** is a personal project inspired by the character Baymax from *Big Hero 6*. This app detects prolonged eye closure using real-time webcam footage, a potential sign of sleep apnea or fatigue. When prolonged eye closure is detected, the application alerts the user. 

This app aims to improve personal health monitoring by providing a fun, interactive way to keep track of eye closure and alertness. It’s an opportunity to explore computer vision, machine learning, and AI principles, specifically applied in healthcare-related applications.

## How It Works

The application uses OpenCV to process webcam footage and detect eye closure in real-time using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). The EAR compares the vertical and horizontal distances of eye landmarks to determine whether the user’s eyes are open or closed.

## Future Expansions

1. Health Tips Integration - For future versions, we can integrate Healthline API or similar resources to provide personalized health tips based on detected eye closure and fatigue.

2. Wearable Device Integration -  Integrating with wearable devices (like fitness trackers) to get a more holistic view of the user’s sleep patterns, movement, and fatigue levels.

3. Physical Baymax Assistant - Create a physical Baymax robot using Arduino with LEDs and servo motors. The robot could react to eye closure events, such as blinking its lights or waving its arms to alert the user.

4. Real-Time Data Scraping - Integrating a feature that pulls real-time health information, research papers, or tips based on current health concerns, such as fatigue or sleep apnea.
